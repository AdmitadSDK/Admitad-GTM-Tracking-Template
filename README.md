## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Admitad Tracking Template for Google Tag Manager provides easy-driven integration with [Admitad](https://www.admitad.com/en/).  
This template tracks usersâ€™ actions on your website and sends the data to the Admitad statistics.  
When the template fires, the Admitad server receives a request with the information on this action (order ID, order amount, etc.).

For more on the Admitad tracking code, see [here](https://help.admitad.com/en/advertiser/topic/227-installing-admitad-tracking-code-in-google-tag-manager#purpose).

* [Journey template](./Journey)
